If you have a Windows PC, it's suggested to install VirtualBox.

### General practices

* The JavaScript variables capital convention is [CamelCase](https://textcaseconvert.com/blog/what-is-camel-case/)

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

If you find an issue that adresses the problems you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](link) can also help with indicating to our maintainers and developers.

### Pull Requests

PRs are the best and quickest way to get your fix, improvement or feature merged. In general, PRs should:

* Only fix/add the functionality in the issue
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible
